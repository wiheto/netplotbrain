# Node properties: size

Netplotbrain allows for specifying different figure properties by only specifyign the column name.

Below we demonstrate how node_size can change based on different columns in the nodes dataframe.

The key lines of code here are when:

`node_size='centrality_measure1'`

and

`node_size='centrality_measure2'`

These columns could be called anything such as "module_degree_zscore" or "efficiency"
